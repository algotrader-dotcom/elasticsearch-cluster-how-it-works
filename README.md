## Questions will be solved
- How a node in cluster talks to others?
- What happens when a node joins or leaves the cluster?
- What happens when a node stops or has encountered a problem?
- What is the role of master/client/data in cluster ?
- What is memory requirement for each node ?

## What is a cluster of nodes ? 
- Start a ES instance -> a cluster of single node.
- Start another ES instance with the same `cluster.name` -> a cluster of 2 nodes.
## What is role of master/client/data ?
## Adding a node to cluster
## Removing a node to cluster
